## How to Play:

Control the wriggly being with either "W+A+S+D" or Arrow Keys and grow it by feeding it with food. Yums~

As they all say, the longer the better, or is it?

In any case, when the game ends just press "ENTER" on the keyboard or click the "RESTART" button to respawn and beat your best score!
