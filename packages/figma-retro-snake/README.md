Worked for too long? Needing a break? Unwind with a classic!

Bringing the retro game we all love into Figma, Snake!

Control the wriggly being with either "W+A+S+D" or Arrow Keys and grow it by feeding it with food. Yums~

As they all say, the longer the better, or is it?

In any case, when the game ends just press "ENTER" on the keyboard or click the "RESTART" button to respawn and beat your best score!
