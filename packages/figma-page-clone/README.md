One-click, fuss-free tool to clone a page.

## How to Use:

- Launch the plugin
- While the plugin is active, you are free to move between pages
- Click on the plugin again once you're on the page you want to clone
- Verify that the "Current Page" name is reflected on the plugin UI
- Select the frames you want to clone
  - Pro-tip: you can pre-select the frames you want to clone before launching the plugin
- Choose a destination page, or select New Page and name the page to be created
- Options available:
  - Detach instances
    - Useful if changes on original file should not affect cloned file
  - Overwrite existing frames with the same name (if you choose to clone to an existing page)
  - Remove hidden layers
  - Automatically lock all frames
- Finally, click on "Clone" and let the plugin do the rest!

## Work-in-Progress:
