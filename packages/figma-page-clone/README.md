One-click, fuss-free tool to clone a page.

## How to Use:

- Launch the plugin
- While the plugin is active, you are free to move between pages
- Click on the plugin again once you're on the page you want to clone
- Verify that the "Selected" page name is reflected on the plugin UI
- Name the clone to be created
- Options available:
  - Remove hidden layers
  - Make in-page copies of required master components
    - Useful if changes on original master components should not affect cloned instances
    - Copies of master components are automatically grouped and hidden
  - Automatically lock all frames
- Finally, click on "Clone" and let the plugin do the rest!

## Work-in-Progress:

- Suggestions are welcome :)
